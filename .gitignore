# Optional / Not-mandatory folders
# --------------------------------
# Use this section to document folders that are optional for the project
# (for example, local build artifacts or editor settings). Leave an entry
# commented out to keep it ignored by git but visible as a suggestion for
# contributors. To track any folder, remove the leading `# ` from that line.

# Examples (uncomment to track):
# dist/                # build output (optional — uncomment if you want to commit built files)
# node_modules/        # dependencies (optional — normally should remain ignored)
# postgres_data/       # local postgres volume used by docker-compose
# .env                 # local environment file (do NOT commit secrets; use .env.example instead)
# .vscode/             # editor settings (optional)

# Recommended default ignores (leave these uncommented if you want them ignored):
node_modules/
dist/
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
.DS_Store
coverage/
.nyc_output/
.vscode/
.idea/
npm-debug.log
*.log
.dockerignore
